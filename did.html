                        answer: "Self-monitoring is a systematic approach to observing, evaluating, and managing one's own teaching behavior to improve understanding and control. Two techniques: (1) Audio/video recording of lessons allows teachers to objectively review their actual classroom interactions, revealing blind spots between their intentions and reality. (2) Action research involves systematically investigating a specific classroom issue, collecting data, and implementing changes based on evidence rather than assumptions."

                        answer: "Teachers' beliefs shape whether they see students as passive vessels needing filling or active collaborators. The 'receptacles' view leads to transmission-style teaching with emphasis on memorization, while the 'partners' perspective fosters collaborative, discovery-based learning. Pedagogically, the former limits student autonomy and critical thinking, while the latter develops higher-order skills and mutual respect."

                        answer: "Traditional approaches emphasized immediate correction of all errors, focusing on accuracy over fluency. Modern approaches prioritize communication, using selective correction that doesn't interrupt the flow of conversation. Teachers now focus on global errors that impede communication rather than local errors, and use techniques like recasting or clarification requests to guide learners without direct correction."

Unlike summative assessment which evaluates learning at the end, formative assessment supports learning through techniques like observations, quizzes, peer feedback, and self-assessment, promoting a growth mindset and continuous development."

Examples include: (1) Modeling language structures before expecting students to produce them, (2) Using graphic organizers to help organize writing, (3) Providing sentence starters for discussions, (4) Breaking complex tasks into smaller steps. The support is gradually removed as learners develop competence."

A good plan includes clear objectives, engaging activities, varied instructional methods, assessment strategies, and differentiation for diverse learners. While plans should be flexible to respond to student needs, having a roadmap increases teaching effectiveness, manages time efficiently, and ensures alignment with curriculum goals."

They expose learners to real language use, cultural context, and current issues. Benefits include increased motivation, development of pragmatic competence, and preparation for real-world communication.

Development requires: (1) Exposure to authentic language use, (2) Opportunities for meaningful interaction, (3) Focus on both accuracy and appropriacy, (4) Awareness of sociocultural norms, (5) Practice in various genres and registers. Tasks should simulate real communication needs, encouraging negotiation of meaning and strategic competence when facing communication breakdowns."
